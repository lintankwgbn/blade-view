## About Blade View Template

An index page is the main entry point to a website, often called a homepage or landing page, that serves as the primary gateway for visitors.
It provides an overview of the site's content and includes navigation to guide users to other pages.
On the web, the index page is also the default page that loads when someone visits a website without specifying a particular page,
with path /app/views/index.blade.php being the most common default name for this file.
