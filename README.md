# Blade View Template

## About Blade View

Blade is Laravel's simple yet powerful built-in templating engine that allows for dynamic view creation using simple syntax and familiar PHP. 
Blade views are compiled into plain PHP code and cached for performance, reducing overhead. 
Key features include template inheritance, sections for structuring views, and directives like @include for reusable components.
